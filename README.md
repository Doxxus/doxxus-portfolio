# My Portfolio

Made this project to learn more about the SvelteKit web stack and to make a cool interative portfolio/resume website.

### Some things I plant to work on in the future:

- Adding background settings including a 'performance mode' that disables background animations
- Fixing mobile compatibility
- Adding a more elegant solution to display skill frameworks.
- Making the contact form work, will need to implement a backend server for this which I'm not too keen on as I like this just being a serverless stateless app
