    "about_text": "Hi, my name is Lachlan, I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and am an avid lover of technology. In my current position, I work primarily with an interesting technology stack comprised of a C# / WPF / Prism front end, a server deployed R backend, and T-SQL databases. I'm currently really interested in doing full stack web development, so I've been using some of my free time to get better at it. When I'm not working, I enjoy tabletop and online gaming with friends, as well as mixing drum and bass music.",
